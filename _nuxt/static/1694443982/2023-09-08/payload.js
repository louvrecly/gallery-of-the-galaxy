At that distance, this 1\u002F3 degree wide field of view spans over 30 light-years. The sharp composite, color image highlights faint details of the region's gas and dust clouds against a backdrop of central Milky Way stars. Stellar winds and energetic light from hot, massive stars formed from M17's stock of cosmic gas and dust have slowly carved away at the remaining interstellar material, producing the cavernous appearance and undulating shapes. M17 is also known as the Omega Nebula or the Swan Nebula.";a.hdurl="https:\u002F\u002Fapod.nasa.gov\u002Fapod\u002Fimage\u002F2309\u002FOmegaNebulaGrandMesaObservatory2023.jpg";a.media_type="image";a.service_version="v1";a.title="Star Factory Messier 17";a.url="https:\u002F\u002Fapod.nasa.gov\u002Fapod\u002Fimage\u002F2309\u002FOmegaNebulaGrandMesaObservatory2023_1024.jpg";return {data:[{post:a}],fetch:{},mutations:[[b,true],["ADD_TO_POSTS_MAP",[a]],["UPDATE_DATES",void 0],[b,false]]}}({},"SET_BUSY_STATE")));
