As a result, two fuzzy cloud-like objects easily visible to southern hemisphere skygazers are known as the Clouds of Magellan, now understood to be satellite galaxies of our much larger, spiral Milky Way galaxy. About 160,000 light-years distant in the constellation Dorado, the Large Magellanic Cloud is seen in this sharp galaxy portrait. Spanning about 15,000 light-years or so, it is the most massive of the Milky Way's satellite galaxies and is the home of the closest supernova in modern times, SN 1987A.  The prominent patch above center is 30 Doradus, also known as the magnificent Tarantula Nebula, a giant star-forming region about 1,000 light-years across.";a.hdurl="https:\u002F\u002Fapod.nasa.gov\u002Fapod\u002Fimage\u002F2309\u002FTheLargeMagellanicCloud.jpg";a.media_type="image";a.service_version="v1";a.title="The Large Cloud of Magellan";a.url="https:\u002F\u002Fapod.nasa.gov\u002Fapod\u002Fimage\u002F2309\u002FTheLargeMagellanicCloud1024.jpg";return {data:[{post:a}],fetch:{},mutations:[[b,true],["ADD_TO_POSTS_MAP",[a]],["UPDATE_DATES",void 0],[b,false]]}}({},"SET_BUSY_STATE")));
