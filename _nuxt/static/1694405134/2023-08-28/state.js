Formed within the nebula, that cluster's young, massive stars ultimately power the pervasive nebular glow. The eye-catching shapes looming in the featured portrait of NGC 281 are sculpted dusty columns and dense Bok globules seen in silhouette, eroded by intense, energetic winds and radiation from the hot cluster stars. If they survive long enough, the dusty structures could also be sites of future star formation. Playfully called the Pacman Nebula because of its overall shape, NGC 281 is about 10,000 light-years away in the constellation Cassiopeia. This sharp composite image was made through narrow-band filters. It combines emission from the nebula's hydrogen and oxygen atoms to synthesize red, green, and blue colors. The scene spans well over 80 light-years at the estimated distance of NGC 281.",hdurl:"https:\u002F\u002Fapod.nasa.gov\u002Fapod\u002Fimage\u002F2308\u002FPacman_Stocks_2560.jpg",media_type:"image",service_version:"v1",title:"Star Formation in the Pacman Nebula",url:"https:\u002F\u002Fapod.nasa.gov\u002Fapod\u002Fimage\u002F2308\u002FPacman_Stocks_1080.jpg"}},dates:[b],likedPostDates:[]},serverRendered:true,routePath:"\u002F2023-08-28",config:{nasaApiKey:"eT9XUQuUYhate3U9NhBig8XSyNCWE7h6PHNlN12M",_app:{basePath:"\u002Fgallery-of-the-galaxy\u002F",assetsPath:"\u002Fgallery-of-the-galaxy\u002F_nuxt\u002F",cdnURL:a}}}}(null,"2023-08-28"));
