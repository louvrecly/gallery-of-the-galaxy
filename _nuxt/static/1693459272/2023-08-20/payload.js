These rare long clouds may form near advancing cold fronts.   In particular, a downdraft from an advancing storm front can cause moist warm air to rise, cool below its dew point, and so form a cloud.  When this happens uniformly along an extended front, a roll cloud may form.  Roll clouds may actually have air circulating along the long horizontal axis of the cloud.  A roll cloud is not thought to be able to morph into a tornado.  Unlike a similar shelf cloud, a roll cloud is completely detached from their parent  cumulonimbus cloud.  Pictured here, a roll cloud extends far into the distance as a storm approaches in 2007 in Racine, Wisconsin, USA.";a.hdurl="https:\u002F\u002Fapod.nasa.gov\u002Fapod\u002Fimage\u002F2308\u002Frollcloud_hanrahan_3072.jpg";a.media_type="image";a.service_version="v1";a.title="A Roll Cloud Over Wisconsin";a.url="https:\u002F\u002Fapod.nasa.gov\u002Fapod\u002Fimage\u002F2308\u002Frollcloud_hanrahan_960.jpg";return {data:[{post:a}],fetch:{},mutations:[[b,true],["ADD_TO_POSTS_MAP",{"2023-08-20":a}],["UPDATE_DATES",void 0],[b,false]]}}({},"SET_BUSY_STATE")));
