Sharp telescopic views like this one reveal the spectacular cluster's hundreds of thousands of stars. At a distance of 25,000 light-years, the cluster stars crowd into a region 150 light-years in diameter. Approaching the cluster core, upwards of 100 stars could be contained in a cube just 3 light-years on a side. For comparison, the closest star to the Sun is over 4 light-years away. The remarkable range of brightness recorded in this image follows stars into the dense cluster core.",hdurl:"https:\u002F\u002Fapod.nasa.gov\u002Fapod\u002Fimage\u002F2309\u002FM13-totale-en-cours-crop8.jpg",media_type:"image",service_version:"v1",title:"The Great Globular Cluster in Hercules",url:"https:\u002F\u002Fapod.nasa.gov\u002Fapod\u002Fimage\u002F2309\u002FM13-totale-en-cours-crop8_1024.jpg"}},dates:[b],likedPostDates:[]},serverRendered:true,routePath:"\u002F2023-09-01",config:{nasaApiKey:"eT9XUQuUYhate3U9NhBig8XSyNCWE7h6PHNlN12M",_app:{basePath:"\u002Fgallery-of-the-galaxy\u002F",assetsPath:"\u002Fgallery-of-the-galaxy\u002F_nuxt\u002F",cdnURL:a}}}}(null,"2023-09-01"));
