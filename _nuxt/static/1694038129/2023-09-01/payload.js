Sharp telescopic views like this one reveal the spectacular cluster's hundreds of thousands of stars. At a distance of 25,000 light-years, the cluster stars crowd into a region 150 light-years in diameter. Approaching the cluster core, upwards of 100 stars could be contained in a cube just 3 light-years on a side. For comparison, the closest star to the Sun is over 4 light-years away. The remarkable range of brightness recorded in this image follows stars into the dense cluster core.";a.hdurl="https:\u002F\u002Fapod.nasa.gov\u002Fapod\u002Fimage\u002F2309\u002FM13-totale-en-cours-crop8.jpg";a.media_type="image";a.service_version="v1";a.title="The Great Globular Cluster in Hercules";a.url="https:\u002F\u002Fapod.nasa.gov\u002Fapod\u002Fimage\u002F2309\u002FM13-totale-en-cours-crop8_1024.jpg";return {data:[{post:a}],fetch:{},mutations:[[b,true],["ADD_TO_POSTS_MAP",{"2023-09-01":a}],["UPDATE_DATES",void 0],[b,false]]}}({},"SET_BUSY_STATE")));
